    <p><h1>Hello.</h1></p>

    <br>This is a story about a young boy, and his name is Curtis 'Rex' Rufus. 

    <br><p style="color:white;">◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆  ◆</p>

    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary. Whether I belonged in this world, or I am a cog in the great machine that is bequeathed unto me. Living a life of solitude, with no parental guidance nor supportive relative in sight. Always belittled, forgotten or dismissed. Caught in a village in Southern Illinois, South Roxana bred ineptitude and ignorance of the outside world and its realworld problems. A quiet, quaint 1,600 residency.<br> 
    <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in a room painted for every little girl's hopes and dreams, of vibrant yellows and paper flower silhouettes that eventually tore from the walls from their degraded, cheap adhesives. Always a chore to clean, always a bother to step outside. Mockery followed me, even through special ed classes where I was promised my safety from constant harassment for my apparent social abnormalities. Furthering to antagonize these harassers provoked more backlash, and so began an endless cycle of blood splattered upon a childish battleground.<br>
    <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Escapism promised my freedom more than elementary and junior high, engrossing upon a high fantasy MMO that is World of Warcraft. This is my first character created: </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffice to say: a troubled youth was concocted from a negligent mother, indulgent of WoW; and inadvertently fueling their escapism to play WoW, a brother whose kindness went as quick as it came for brooding hatred and bruteful lashings. And a father, whom shall never see the light of day beyond his confinement. My sister, gone without knowing I would yet exist in the future.<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never had I dealt with the consequences of reality, nor had I thought my actions would take their toll on peoples' trust and friendliness towards me. I cared little, sheltered and kept at arm's length. Opening up is quite a challenge, even today I cannot find myself to trust other people because of past incidences.<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning about weight and confidence at a young age can alter your perspective; the porcelain proverbial feminine physique one can identify to be a white, skinny woman, whose hair shines gold and eyes reflect the sea. Naturally, anorexia proved to be my achievement in attaining said feminine physique. In reference to this self-enforced dieting, my family's nutrients were even stricter. A healthy balance of tacos, hamburgers, maccaroni & cheese, spaghetti, Dairy Queen, McDonalds, or KFC. We never explored outside of our boundaries, save for dear old mother.<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2016 of my days attending Lewis & Clark Community College, I confessed in front of my sociology class that I've never enjoyed the pleasures of consuming certain food groups, and they were (as expected) taken aback by this depravity, even disbelieving I was from America. Here was the list I sent to my professor, that we had to prepare a "Food Day" to help me better my experience with food and know their tastes. </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> As well with 2016 rolling by, I had continued writing more often than usual. Tumblr was my second platform to express my adulation for the macabre, poetic verses and vivid imagery that all I had sought for. Here are some pieces from most of my blogs: <br>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> I've always a passion for art. And it has not improved once. Not at all; HOWEVER! That is not to say my Photoshop editing skills haven't! Here are my background images for most of my tumblr blogs!<br>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Fun fact: This was my first attempt at a .gif "promo banner" (to promote your rolepaly blog on tumblr) because they were becoming very popular at the time! Of course I only had baby's first knowledge of editing .gifs on PS. <br>
